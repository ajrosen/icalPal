# icalPal

## Description

icalPal is a command-line tool to query a macOS Calendar database for
accounts, calendars, and events.  It can be run on any system with
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and access to a Calendar database
file.

## Installation

```
gem install icalPal
icalPal events
```

## Features

### Compatability with [icalBuddy](https://github.com/ali-rantakari/icalBuddy)

icalPal tries to be compatible with icalBuddy for command-line options
and for output.  There are a few differences to be aware of.

* Options require two hyphens, except for single-letter options that require one hyphen
* *eventsFrom* is not supported.  Instead there is *--from*, *--to*, and *--days*
* icalPal does not support the *tasks* commands yet
* The command can go anywhere; it doesn't have to be the last argument
* Property separators are comma-delimited

### Additional commands

```icalPal accounts```

Shows a list of enabled Calendar accounts.  Internally they are known as *Stores*; you can run ```icalPal stores``` instead.

### Additional options

* Options can be abbreviated, so long as they are unique.  Eg., ```icalPal -c ev --da 3``` is the same as ```icalPal -c events --days 3```.
* The ```-c``` part is optional, but you cannot abbreviate the command if you leave it off.
* Use ```-o``` to print the output in different formats.  CSV or JSON are intertesting choices.
* Copy your Calendar database file and use ```--db``` on it.
* ```--it``` and ```--et``` will filter by Calendar *type*.  Types are **Local**, **Exchange**, **CalDAV**, **MobileMe**, **Subscribed**, and **Birthdays**
* ```--ia``` includes *only* all-day events (opposite of ```--ea```)
* ```--aep``` is like ```--iep```, but *adds* to the default property list instead of replacing it.
* ```--sep``` to separate by any property, not just calendar (```--sc```) or date (```--sd```)
* ```--color``` uses a wider color palette.  Calendar colors are what you have chosen in the Calendar app.  Not supported in all terminals, but looks great in [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

Because icalPal is written in Ruby, and not a native Mac application, you can run it just about anywhere.  It's been tested with version of Ruby (2.6.10) included with macOS, and does not require any external dependencies.

## History

I have used icalBuddy for many years.  It's great for scripting,
automation, and as a desktop widget for apps like
[GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/) and
[Ãœbersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

As with many applications, I started to run into some limitations in
icalBuddy.  The biggest being that active development ended in 2014.
It's only thanks to the efforts of [Jim
Lawton](https://github.com/jimlawton) that it even compiles anymore.

Instead of trying to understand and extend the existing code, I chose
to start anew using my language of choice.  Using Ruby means icalPal
is multi-platform.  It also meant *much* less code; about 1,200 lines
vs. 7,000.

I won't pretend to understand **why** you would want this on Linux or
Windows.  But since icalPal is written in Ruby and gets its data
directly from the Calendar database file instead of an API, you *can*.

## Output formats

icalPal supports several output formats.  The **default** format tries
to mimic icalBuddy as much as possible.

CSV, Hash, JSON, and YAML print all fields for all items in their
respective formats.  From that you can analyze the results any way you like.

[Remind](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/) format uses a minimal implementation built in icalPal.

Other formats such as ANSI, HTML, Markdown, RDoc, and TOC, use Ruby's
[RDoc::Markup](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup.html)
framework to build and render the items.

Each item to be printed is a new
[RDoc::Markup::Document](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Document.html).

When using one of the <em>separate by</em> options, a section header is added first.  The section contains:

* [RDoc::Markup::BlankLine](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/BlankLine.html)
  (unless this is the first section)
* RDoc::Markup::Heading (level 1)
* [RDoc::Markup::Rule](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Rule.html)

The rest of the document is a series of
[RDoc::Markup::List](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/List.html)
objects, one for each of the item's properties:

* [RDoc::Markup::List](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/List.html)
* RDoc::Markup::Heading (level 2)
* [RDoc::Markup::BlankLine](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/BlankLine.html)
* [RDoc::Markup::ListItem](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/ListItem.html)
* [RDoc::Markup::Paragraph](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Paragraph.html)

The document will also include a number of
[RDoc::Markup::Verbatim](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Verbatim.html)
items.  They are not included in the output, but are used to pass
information about the item and property to the default formatter.
