## History

If you've found this page it's likely you've heard of [icalBuddy](https://github.com/ali-rantakari/icalBuddy):

> Command-line utility for printing events and tasks from the OS X calendar database.

I have used icalBuddy for many years.  It's great for scripting,
automation, and as a desktop widget for apps like
[GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/) and
[Ãœbersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

As with many applications, I started to run into some limitations in
icalBuddy.  The biggest being that active development ended over 8
years ago.  It's only thanks to the efforts of [Jim
Lawton](https://github.com/jimlawton) that it even compiles anymore.

Instead of trying to understand and extend the existing code, I chose
to start anew using my language of choice.

- Output in CSV, JSON, HTML, Markdown, and [more](#label-Output+formats)
- Enhanced color option[#label-Usage]
- Show and filter by Account
- Show and filter by Calendar type
- Select a different Calendar database
- Multi-platform
- Much less code (1200 lines vs. 7000)

I won't pretend to understand **why** you would want this on Linux or
Windows.  But since icalPal is written in Ruby and gets its data
directly from the Calendar database file instead of an API, you *can*.

## Output formats

icalPal supports several output formats.  The +default+ format tries
to mimic icalBuddy as much as possible.

CSV, Hash, JSON, and YAML print all fields for all items in their
respective formats.  From that you can analyze the results any way you like.

All other formats, ANSI, HTML, Markdown, RDoc, and TOC, use Ruby's
[RDoc::Markup](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup.html)
framework to build and render the items.

Each item to be printed is a new
[RDoc::Markup::Document](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Document.html).

When using one of the <em>separate by</em> options, a section header is added first.  The section contains:

* [RDoc::Markup::BlankLine](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/BlankLine.html)
  (unless this is the first section)
* RDoc::Markup::Heading (level 1)
* [RDoc::Markup::Rule](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Rule.html)

The rest of the document is a series of
[RDoc::Markup::List](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/List.html)
objects, one for each of the item's properties:

* [RDoc::Markup::List](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/List.html)
* RDoc::Markup::Heading (level 2)
* [RDoc::Markup::BlankLine](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/BlankLine.html)
* [RDoc::Markup::ListItem](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/ListItem.html)
* [RDoc::Markup::Paragraph](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Paragraph.html)

The document will also include a number of
[RDoc::Markup::Verbatim](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.10/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/Verbatim.html)
items.  The are not included in the output, but are used to pass
information about the item and property to the default formatter.
